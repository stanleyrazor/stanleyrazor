My name is Stanley Sayianka, an aspiring machine learning research scientist. I am a data scientist trained in statistical methods, with a focus on quantitative finance (so far). I thoroughly enjoy studying machine learning, and strive to combine my studies with daily experiences in order to deliver valuable insights wherever I am. In my studies, I love exploring how learning algorithms actually learn, how they respond to changes, and how they evolve to handle the ever-growing complexity of the real world.

My interests lie in: Machine learning, probabilistic(bayesian) reasoning, information theory, and algorithmic trading.
